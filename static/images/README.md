# Social images

These are all 64px wide, many were resized from higher resolution images with
[GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) when were processed by
[pngcrush](http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/) to reduce their size. Both are
free software.

They are meant to be used with "width=32 height=32" so they look good on hidpi
devices (e.g. iPhone/iPad, high end Android phones, Chromebook Pixel, MacBook
Pro, etc).
